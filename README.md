# Stormplot
Beta tool for tracking your location relative to a local storm's
## Purpose
The name is not set in stone for this project. The tool exists because when I was in a severe thunderstorm I could not find an app that, in real time, plotted my location relative to the boundaries of the storm I needed to avoid. 
## Advantages
1. No need to pull over when on the road to plan how to avoid a storm
2. Know exactly where the storm is headed (Cardinal Directions), and thus precise velocity. 
3. No need to wait for updates from Google Public Alerts or the National Weather Service
4. Automatic alerts (in progress) to guide you through the situation

## Implementations/Tools
1. National Weather Service warnings RSS feed
2. FCC Census Block Conversions API
3. Google Public Alerts (for now)
4. PHP/Javascript/JQuery
5. Google Maps

### Updates
For now just keep an eye on the commit log. I will post updates here as it becomes necessary.
